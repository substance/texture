<!-- models, or attribute lists of the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- Or-groups within models should use mixes or -->

<!-- This DTD was created from the JATS DTD Suite. -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers may use the -->
<!-- DTD as is for markup of journal literature or -->
<!-- related material for archiving and transferring -->
<!-- such material between archives or create a -->

<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article Tag -->
<!-- Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->

  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
      =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
   30. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   29. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   28.  RUBY MODEL CHANGED TO MATCH HTML5
        - changed the Ruby content model to allow only a single
          Ruby annotation on a single Ruby base:
              (rb, (rt | (rp, rt, rp)) )
          The Ruby textual annotation may take a pair of
          Ruby parentheses, but these are optional.
  
   27. ATTRIBUTES FOR PUB-ID
     - Added the linking attributes (optional version) to <pub-id> , 
       so that a <pub-id> that is a DOI, for example, can carry the 
       linking attributes and be made into a live link. In this use
       of <pub-id>, the element is acting both as an identifier
       and as a link.
     - Added new attribute @assigning-authority to <pub-id>, to
       carry new values such as "CrossRef" and to take some of the
       semantic burden off the @pub-id-type attribute, when
       values are organizations such as "Genbank" or "PDB".
  
   26. <OBJECT-ID> INSIDE <TRANS-ABSTRACT>
       Allowed <object-id> at the beginning of <trans-abstract>, 
       so that abstracts could be given DOIs.
  
   25. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>
     - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
       be distinguished using @content-type
     - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
       <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
       to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
       and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
       numbers.
  
   24. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   23. NEW <era> ELEMENT
       Added <era> through date-parts.class to:
        - <conf-date>
        - <date-in-citation>
        - <pub-date>
        - <string-date>
        - access-date (deprecated
        - time-stamp (deprecated)
  
   22. INSTITUTIONS TO STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS
       Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
       through the institution-wrap.class:
        - <copyright-holder>
        - <std-organization>
  
   21. RUBY ANNOTATIONS - Overrode the default JATS inclusions, to
       change the more restricted face-markup class to the 
       Archive-specific all Phrase. Elements change:
        - <rb> Ruby Base (through %rb-elements;)
  
   20. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
  
   19. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
       - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
         (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
          - disp-formula (through %disp-formula-elements;)
  
       - Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
         and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
         classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
         ways to be invoked.
          - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   18. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
       <related-article> was used, including inside 
       <article-meta> using article-meta-model.
  
   17. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the 
       <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
       such as publishers-specific IDs,  and ORCIDs.
  
   16. VERSE-LINE ELEMENTS - Added the PE %verse-line-elements to
       this module because the default expanded, and Archiving did
       not need to expand as it already was expanded.
  
   14. DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added attributes to <date> through @date-atts: 
         a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
            of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
         b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
            naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
            "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
         c) Added @publication-format, so that both publication
            dates and history dates can separate the format of the
            publication from the version/lifecycle event. Thus
            both an "article" and a "manuscript" might be received.
  
   13. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
       to increase what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
  
   12. XREF REF TYPES - #9 below says "XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed 
       the %xref-atts PE from this module since the regular version 
       (in xlink3.ent) was equally inclusive. But it is NOT. 
       Brought back %xref-atts;
  
   11. ISSN-L ELEMENTS - Added <x> TO <issn-l> via 
       %issn-l-elements;
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
   10. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
    9. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.
  
    7. XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed the %xref-atts PE from this module
       since the regular version (in xlink3.ent) was equally inclusive.
  
    6. ISSUE - Allowed to repeat inside <article-meta>
  
    5. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
       to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
       will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
       single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
       in two languages or two scripts.
  
    4. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
       entity %person-group-model: was changed to
       %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
       as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
       been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
       set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.
  
    3. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
       @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
       to the following over-rides:
        - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-user only)
        - award-id through award-id-atts (both)
        - date through date-atts (@specific-use only)
        - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
        - pub-id through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only)
        - trans-title through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only;
           @xml:lang already)
        - xref through xref-atts (both)
  
    2. STRING-DATE - Added <string-date> back to the following
       elements using %citation-additions.class;. It was accidentally
       deleted during the 3.0 revision of -references.class:
        - product         (%product-elements;)
        - related-article (%related-article-elements;)
        - related-object  (%related-object-elements;)
        - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
  
    1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"
