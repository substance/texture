  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
   31. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   30. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   29. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>
     - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
       be distinguished using @content-type
     - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
       <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
       to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
       and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
       information.
     - Made <issue> repeatable, for those who choose not to use
       the new wrapper element.
  
   28. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   27. NEW <era> ELEMENT
       Added <era> through date-model
        - <pub-date>
  
   26. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
       This added a new attribute list to:
        - article-categories
        - article-meta
        - counts
        - history
        - title-group                          
  
   25. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS
         Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
         and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
         classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
         ways to be invoked.
          - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   24. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
       <related-article> was used, including inside 
       <article-meta> using article-meta-model.
  
   23. CONTRIB-GROUP AND CONTRIB MODULE SHIFT - Moved <contrib>
       and <contrib-group> to common.ent, since they are now used
       in both article metadata and journal metadata.
  
   22. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
       at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
       such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, and JST and NII 
       identifiers.
  
   21. COUNTS - Generic <count> element added to the <counts>
       wrapper. This element is allowed to repeat, to count
       anything a publisher or archive may wish to count.
       The @count-type attribute will name what is being counted
       (such as figures, tables, sections, contributors, images,
       etc.) The @count attribute will state how many of the 
       objects are in the document.
  
       Although a publisher or archive could choose to label
       all the counted objects in a document this way, the
       specific count elements (fig-count, equation-count,
       word-count, etc.) will be retained for backwards
       compatibility.
  
       New parameter entities: count-atts.
  
   20. PUBLICATION DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added to the attributes for
       <pub-date> (through @pub-date-atts):
         a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
            of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
         b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
            naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
            "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
         c) @date-type to record lifecycle information as to which
            publication date is involved (such as retracted, corrected,
            preprint).
         d) @publication-format to hold what format or media was 
            published on this date (such as "print" or
            "electronic").
         e) @xml:lang (comments below said was this added for 0.4).
  
   19. COMPOUND KEYWORD PARTS - Allowed the individual compound 
       keyword parts (<compound-kwd-part> to be as complex as 
       ordinary keywords <kwd>), by giving them the same model 
       as <kwd>.
  
   18. NESTED KEYWORDS - Added new keyword type element for nested
       keywords (<nested-kwd>), to hold hierarchical keywords such
       as taxonomic structures. New PEs %nested-kwd-model; and
       %nested-kwd-atts;
  
   17. MODULE MOVEMENT (from increased reference content)
  
       a) Element <degrees> - Moved <degrees> and its parameter
          entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
  
       b) Element <supplement> - Moved <supplement> and its parameter
          entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
  
       c) Element <conf-sponsor> - Moved <conf-sponsor> and its parameter
          entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
  
       d) Element <on-behalf-of> - Moved <on-behalf-of> and its parameter
          entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
  
   16. Added name comment to %counts-model;
  
   15. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
       public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
   14. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
   13. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.
  
   12. UNSTRUCTURED KEYWORD GROUP ATTRIBUTES - Made
       %unstructured-kwd-group-atts; into its own PE, as
       documentation stated had already been done.
  
   11. KEYWORD ATTRIBUTES - To make the tag set more consistent,
       added @content-type to <kwd>, since <compound-kwd> already
       took this attribute. Through %kwd-atts;
  
   10. I18N - At the request of the SBJ Working Group (Japan)
       made <series-text> repeatable inside <article-categories> using
       %article-categories-model;
  
    9. TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
       <subtitle> and <alt-title> modeled with the same parameter
       entity %title-elements;. Created new PEs for each element
       but set them (as the default) to %title-elements so that no
       customization would break. Models changed:
         - alt-title    %alt-title-elements; defined in common.ent
         - subtitle     %subtitle-elements; (moved to this
             module)
  
    8. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
       to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
       will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
       single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
       in two languages or two scripts.
  
    7. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
       @xml:lang to the following elements:
        - alt-title through alt-title-atts (both)
        - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-use only)
        - author-comment through author-comment-atts (both)
        - author-notes through author-notes-atts (both)
        - article-id through article-id-atts (@xml:lang)
        - contrib through contrib-atts (@specific-use only)
        - contrib-group through contrib-group-atts (@xml:lang)
        - corresp through corresp-atts (@specific-use)
        - degrees through degrees-atts (both)
        - kwd-group through kwd-group-atts (@specific-use only
               @xml:lang already there)
        - on-behalf-of through on-behalf-of-atts (both) NEW PE
        - product through product-atts (both)
        - pub-date through pub-date-atts (@xml:lang)
        - self-uri through self-uri-atts (both)
        - series-text through series-text-atts (both)
        - series-title through series-title-atts (both)
        - string-conf through string-conf-atts (both)
        - subj-group through subj-group-atts (both)
        - subtitle through subtitle-atts (@specific only
               @xml:lang already there)
        - supplement through supplement-atts (both)
  
    6. TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
       <subtitle> and <alt-title> modeled with the same parameter
       entity %title-elements;. Created new PEs for each element
       but set them (as the default) to %title-elements so that no
       customization would break.
  
    5. COUNT ATTRIBUTES - Removed the dependency which had all of
       the count elements using a single attribute list (%count-atts;)
       Created new attributes list PEs for each of them: equation-count,
       fig-count, page-count, ref-count, table-count, and word-count.
       *****Customization Alert: New parameter entities could break
       some customizations. Check the attribute list parameter entity
       for each of the count elements. *****
  
    4. COMPOUND SUBJECT - Created a new element <compound-subject>
       that acts just like <compound-kwd>, in that it takes one or
       more <compound-subject-part>s to allow a complex, multi-
       part subject to be captured. New elements, attribute lists,
       and parameter entities. (An example of a compound subject
       is a code with a textual keyword (A11 Permeability).
       Allowed <compound-subject> as an alternative to <subject>
       inside a <subj-group>.
  
    3. SERIES TEXT ATTRIBUTES - Both <series-title> and
       <series-text> used to use the PE %series-title-atts;. Added the
       PE %series-text-atts;, which is the only one <series-text>
       uses. No documents need change.
       *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
       customizations. Check your <series-text> attributes. *****
  
    2. TRANSLATED ABSTRACT ATTRIBUTES - Both <abstract> and
       <trans-abstract> used to use the PE %abstract-atts;. Added the
       PE %trans-abstract-atts;, which is the only one <trans-abstract>
       uses. No documents need change.
       *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
       customizations. Check your <trans-abstract> attributes. *****
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
  
    1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"

                        GROUPING ARTICLES IN SERIES
    Series (as used in the <series-title> and
    <series-text> elements described below) is
    used in two different senses. Some issues of
    journals are part of a series and will have
    series information just as they have an
    issue number as part of the article metadata,
    to describe the issue of the journal in which
    the article is published.  The second usage
    is for groupings of articles within one
    issue of a journal. For example, in some
    journals, articles are grouped into a
    series such as "From the Cover" and
    identified as part of a series.
    The Series Title element names the series
    and the Series Text element provides textual
    description (if any) describing the series.

  <!-- COUNT -->
  <!--
    Generic <count> element to count anything a 
    publisher or archive may wish to count in a 
    document. The @count-type attribute will name 
    what is being counted (such as figures, 
    tables, sections, contributors, images,
    etc.) The @count attribute will state how 
    many of the objects are in the document. 
    
    Although a publisher or archive could choose 
    to label all the counted objects in a document
    using this element, the specific count 
    elements (fig-count, equation-count,
    word-count, etc.) will be retained for 
    backwards compatibility, and may still be
    used.
