<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- This module was created for the JATS DTD Suite. -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers may use the -->
<!-- DTD as is for markup of journal literature or -->
<!-- related material for archiving and transferring -->
<!-- such material between archives or create a -->
<!-- custom XML DTD from the Suite for -->
<!-- these purposes. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article Tag -->
<!-- Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article -->
<!-- Tag Suite (JATS)." -->

<!---->
<!-- This module is part of the JATS DTD Suite. The -->
<!-- Suite is a continuation of work done by NCBI, -->
<!-- Mulberry Technologies, and Inera, Inc. on the NLM -->
<!--              Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite, which -->
<!-- was originally released in December, 2002. -->
<!---->
<!-- NLM thanks the Harvard University Libraries, both -->
<!-- for proposing that a draft archiving NLM DTD for -->
<!-- life sciences journals be extended to accommodate -->
<!-- journals in all disciplines and for sponsoring -->
<!-- Inera Inc.'s collaboration with other DTD -->
<!-- authors in completing NLM Version 1.0. The -->
<!-- Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided support for -->
<!-- these important contributions. -->

<!-- Suggestions for refinements and enhancements to -->

       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
    5. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
    4. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting

       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
    3. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
    2. XML Base
       Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
       attributes used on all elements.

<!-- COMMON ATTRIBUTES -->
<!--
  These lists of attributes will be added to 
  nearly every element, in both the document 
  metadata and the document body, of the entire 
  Tag Set:
    - including table elements for both the 
        XHTML-inspired and OASIS-inspired
        table model elements
    - excluding only <mml:math> and 
        <xi:include> (whose namespaces JATS
        does not control).
     Great care should be taken to use these
  attributes judiciously, not as a shortcut to
  thinking through where an attribute should be
  used. Potential use cases include adding
  @xml:lang or some RDFa attribute to every 
  elements.

<!-- BASE ATTRIBUTES -->
<!--
  Holds all the common attributes except @id.
  Used to keep the two common attribute lists 
  in sync. To add a global attribute, modify
  this list.
