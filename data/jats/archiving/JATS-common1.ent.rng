  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
   51. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   50. ALI (NISO Access and License Indicators)
       - Added <ali:license_ref> to license-p.class, as 
         alternatives inside <license>
       - Use the new class: license.class to hold the new ALI
         element <ali:free_to_read>, as an alternative to
         <license> inside <permissions>.
       - Created new parameter entity 'anyURI' to act as 
         documentation concerning the content of any element whose
         content is intended to be a URI.  
  
   49. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
  
   48. VOLUME ISSUE GROUPING
     - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
       <article-meta), following all volume and issue elements,
       to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
       and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
       information.
  
   47. NEW ATTRIBUTE VALUES FOR @PUB-ID-TYPE
       Added three new values to @pub-id-types:
        - accession
        - arc
        - handle
  
   46. NEW ATTRIBUTE FOR EXT-LINK
       Added the CDATA attribute @assigning-authority to <ext-link>
       to the authority (such as CrossRef) responsible for the
       link
  
   45. NEW ATTRIBUTE FOR CONTRIB-ID
       Added the boolean attribute @authenticated to <contrib-id> to 
       record whether the agency that assigned the <contrib-id>
       says the identifier is authenticated. The default value
       is "false"
  
   44. MORE LINKING POSSIBILITIES
       Added the might-link-atts to:
        - volume-id
        - issue-id
       so that these potentially external identifiers can link,
       for example to a DOI.
  
   43. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
   42. NEW ADDRESS ELEMENTS
        - Added 3 new elements: <city>, <state>, <postal-code>
        - Therefore introduced new PEs: city-element, state-elements,
          and postal-code-elements, all set initially to null strings.
        - Therefore introduced new PEs: city-atts, state-atts,
          and postal-code-atts.
        - Added the elements (in the default classes module) to:
            - address.class
            - addrress-line.class
          which adds then to: address, addr-line, aff, collab, 
          conf-loc, corresp, publisher-loc
  
   41. CHANGES TO <collab>
       Added @symbol attribute.
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   40. CHANGES TO <on-behalf-of>
       Added <institution>, <institution-wrap>, and <xref>
  
   39. NEW <contrib> ATTRIBUTE
       Added @xml:lang as requested with <institution-id>
  
   38. NEW <era> ELEMENT
       Added <era> through date-parts.class to:
        - <string-date>
  
   37. NEW ELEMENT <era>
       Added to the model of <date>, optional following year,
       through date-model.
  
   36. XML Base
       Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
       attributes used on all elements.
  
   35. INSTITUTION WRAP ADDED
       Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
       through the institution-wrap.class:
        - <copyright-holder>
        - <on-behalf-of>
        - <publisher-name>
        - <std-organization>
  
   34. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
       This added a new attribute list to:
        - aff-alternatives
        - alternatives
        - citation-alternatives
        - collab-alternatives
        - custom-meta-group
        - institution-wrap
        - meta-name
        - meta-value
        - name-alternatives
        - permissions                          
  
   33. INSTITUTIONAL IDENTIFIERS
       - Added <institution-id> to hold institutional identifiers
         whether publisher specific ("AIP") or from an established 
         authorities ("Ringgold" and "ISNI").
  
       - Added <institution-wrap> to hold both the name of an
         institution <institution> and all of its institutional 
         identifiers <institution-id>. This element will be allowed
         everywhere institution is allowed.
  
  
   32. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
       - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
         (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
          - sec-meta (through %sec-meta-model;)
  
   31. ATTRIBUTE ALIGNMENT
       - Added @publication-format and @content-type to <issn>
         through %issn-atts The idea is to make the attributes
         for <issn> and <isbn> as similar as possible.
  
       - Added @publication-format to <isbn> through %isbn-atts 
  
       The idea is to make the attributes for <issn> and <isbn> as 
       similar as possible. <issn> retains @pub-type for historical
       reasons. <issn-l> attributes do not change.
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   30. CONTRIB-GROUP AND CONTRIB MODULE SHIFT - Moved <contrib>
       and <contrib-group> to common.ent from the module
       articlemeta.ent, since they are now used
       in both article metadata and journal metadata.
  
   29. CONTRIB ID - Added new element <contrib-id> using new PE 
       contrib-id.class, contrib-id-atts, contrib-id-model.
       Element holds one identifier, such as an ORCID, for a
       person such as a contributor or principal investigator.
  
   28. COLLABORATION ALTERNATIVES - Added new element 
       <collab-alternatives> using new PE %collab-alternatives-model;.
       Element holds different versions (for example, different
       language renderings) of a single collaboration.   
  
   27. DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added date attributes
        - to <conf-date> through %conf-date-atts
        - to <date> through %date-atts
        - to <string-date> through %string-date-atts
        - to <year> through %year-atts
  
         a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
            of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
  
         b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
            naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
            "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
  
         c) Added @publication-format, so that both publication
            dates and history dates can separate the for amt of the
            publication from the version/lifecycle event. Thus
            both an "article" and a "manuscript" might be received.
  
   27. PUBLICATION IDENTIFIER @pub-id-type
        - Added "std-designation" as value in predefined  list 
          for @pub-id-type (%pub-id-types;).
        - Added new value "arxiv" as value in predefined  list 
          for @pub-id-type (%pub-id-types;).
       "pub-id-types" are used within citations for 
       <object-id> and <pub-id>; 
       used within the article metadata for <article-id>, 
       <issue-id>, and <volume-id>; 
       used within many body elements for <object-id>.
  
   26. LONG DESCRIPTION - Added the might-link attributes to
       <long-desc> because of an argument over what <long-desc>
       should be. The semantic web folks want it to be a URI, the
       librarians and accessibility (for pronouncing readers) want
       to find a real description there, not a link. So JATS needs
       to handle both.
  
   25. ISSN Linking - Added new element <issn-l> with the usual
       %issn-l-elements; and %issn-l-atts;.
  
   24. MODULE MOVEMENT (from increased reference content)
  
       a) Element <degrees> - Moved <degrees> and its parameter
          entities into this module from JATS-articlemeta.ent.
  
       b) Element <supplement> - Moved <supplement> and its parameter
          entities into this module from JATS-articlemeta.ent.
  
       c) Element <conf-sponsor> - Moved <conf-sponsor> and its parameter
          entities into this module from JATS-articlemeta.ent.
  
       d) Element <on-behalf-of> - Moved <on-behalf-of> and its parameter
          entities into this module from JATS-articlemeta.ent.
  
   23. Element <license-p> - Added @content-type, which can hold
       values such as "open-access", "CCC-statement",
       "non-commercial-use".
  
   22. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
       public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
   21. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
   18. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.
  
   17. MIXED CITATION ATTS PE - Was defined twice, identically,
       deleted one of them.
  
   16. ACCESSIBILITY - Added @alt to <label> thru %label-atts;
  
   15. ALTERNATIVES ATTRIBUTES- Created a new parameter entity for
       attributes for <alternatives>; currently null
  
   14. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
       @xml:lang to the following elements:
         - anonymous through anonymous-atts (both) NEW PE
         - conf-acronym through conf-acronym-atts (both)
         - conf-date through conf-date-atts (both)
         - conf-loc through conf-loc-atts (both)
         - conf-name through conf-name-atts (both)
         - conf-num through conf-num-atts (both)
         - conf-sponsor through conf-sponsor-atts (both)
         - conf-theme through conf-theme-atts (both)
         - day through day-atts (@specific-use)
         - degrees through degrees-atts (both)
         - element-citation through citation-atts (both)
         - etal through etal-atts (both) NEW PE
         - ext-link through ext-link-atts (@xml:lang; @specific-use
             already)
         - institution through institution-atts (both)
         - issue-part through issue-part (both + content-type) NEW PE
         - isbn through isbn-atts (both) NEW PE
         - label through label-atts (both) NEW PE
         - mixed-citation through citation-atts (both)
         - name through name-atts (@xml:lang; @specific-use already)
         - notes through notes-atts (both)
         - prefix through prefix-atts (both)
         - publisher-loc through publisher-loc-atts (both)
         - publisher-name through publisher-name-atts (both)
         - string-name through string-name-atts (both and
              content-type and name-style) NEW PE
         - suffix through suffix-atts (both)
         - textual-form through textual-form-atts (both)
         - trans-subtitle through trans-subtitle-atts
            (@xml:lang only) NEW PE
         - x through x-atts (both)
  
   13. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Created new the element
       <aff-alternatives> to hold multiple <aff>s that are
       representations of a single affiliation, for example, the
       name of an institution in two languages or two scripts.
       New PE; New attribute PE (currently null)
  
   12. RELATED-ARTICLE-ATTS - Removed the dependency that tied
       %related-article-atts to journal-id-atts and added all
       the journal-id attributes to related-article-atts explicitly.
  
   11. TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
       <subtitle> and <alt-title> modeled with the same parameter
       entity %title-elements;. Created new PEs for each element
       but set them (as the default) to %title-elements so that no
       customization would break. Models changed:
         - alt-title      %alt-title-elements;
         - subtitle       %subtitle-elements; (defined in
                                  article-meta3.ent;)
         - trans-title    %trans-title-elements;
         - trans-subtitle %trans-subtitle-elements;
  
   10. TEXTUAL FORM MODEL - Changed the textual-form-elements
       parameter entity to begin with an OR bar, since it names
       elements to be mixed with #PCDATA.
       *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
       customizations. Check your %textual-form-elements parameter
       entity. *****
  
    9. PUBLISHER - Allowed <publisher-name> and <publisher-loc> to
       repeat (as an unnamed-parenthetical) inside <publisher>.
       This will allow co-publishers and publisher names and locations
       in more than one language. Added to facilitate multiple
       languages. Also added @specific-use and @xml:lang to
       both publisher-name and publisher-loc.
  
    8. ATTLIST PARAMETER ENTITIES - Changed the attribute lists
       from using the same parameter entity (%day-atts;) to using:
         - day    %day-atts;   (no change)
         - month  %month-atts;
         - season %season-atts;
  
    7. ISBN - Added "isbn" as value in predefined list for
       @pub-id-type (%pub-id-types;)
  
    6. TEXTUAL FORM - Added the following attributes: (new)
         - @specific-use
         - @xml:lang
  
    5. NAME ALTERNATIVES - Created a new wrapper element for more
       than one version of a personal name, for example, the name in
       Japanese kana characters and a transliterated form of the name
       in Latin alphabet, or a regular name and a search version
       that transliterates umlauts to unaccented characters.
        - new element <name-alternatives>
        - new PE name-alternatives-model
        - new PE name-alternatives-atts (currently null)
  
    4. STRING NAME - Added the following attributes: (new)

    Inline elements appear only inside a

    and lists may appear either within a
    paragraph or at the same level as a
    paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
    repository DTD, since some incoming material
    will have restricted such elements to only
    inside a paragraph, some incoming material
    will have restricted them to only outside a
    paragraph and some may allow them in both
    places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
    be in either or both.

    OR bar
