<!-- PURPOSE:    To declare the Parameter Entities (PEs) used to -->
<!-- define the default element classes. Classes are -->
<!-- OR-groups of elements that are defined together -->
<!-- to be used in mixes and in Element Declarations. -->
<!---->
<!-- Note: Since PEs must be declared before they -->
<!-- are used, this module must be called before all -->
<!-- content modules that declare elements, and after -->
<!-- the class customization module (if any). -->
<!---->
<!-- CONTAINS:   PEs that define the element classes to be used -->
<!-- in the JATS DTD Suite modules. -->

<!---->
<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- This module was created for the JATS DTD Suite. -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers may use the -->
<!-- DTD as is for markup of journal literature or -->
<!-- related material for archiving and transferring -->
<!-- such material between archives or create a -->
<!-- custom XML DTD from the Suite for -->
<!-- these purposes. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article Tag -->
<!-- Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article -->
<!-- Tag Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- ORIGINAL CREATION DATE: -->
<!-- August 2004 -->

<!-- CREATED BY: Mulberry Technologies, Inc. for the NISO Z39.96 -->
<!-- Working Group. Mulberry Technologies was -->
<!-- supported by National Center for Biotechnology -->
<!-- Information (NCBI), a center of the US National -->
<!-- Library of Medicine (NLM). -->
<!---->
<!-- This module is part of the JATS DTD Suite. The -->
<!-- Suite is a continuation of work done by NCBI, -->
<!-- Mulberry Technologies, and Inera, Inc. on the NLM -->
<!--              Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite, which -->
<!-- was originally released in December, 2002. -->
<!---->
<!-- NLM thanks the Harvard University Libraries, both -->
<!-- for proposing that a draft archiving NLM DTD for -->
<!-- life sciences journals be extended to accommodate -->
<!-- journals in all disciplines and for sponsoring -->
<!-- Inera Inc.'s collaboration with other DTD -->
<!-- authors in completing NLM Version 1.0. The -->
<!-- Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided support for -->
<!-- these important contributions. -->

  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)
  
       JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
       requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
       JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
       identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
       No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
  
   32. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
  
       The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
       License and Indicators Recommended Practice.
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   32. ALI (NISO Access and License Indicators)
       - Added <ali:license_ref> to license-p.class, as 
         alternatives inside <license>
       - Created a new class: license.class to hold the new ALI
         element <ali:free_to_read>, as an alternative to
         <license> inside <permissions>. 
  
   31. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"
  
       =============================================================
       JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
  
       NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
       requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
       Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
       membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
  
       This catalog represents an interim version of the
       non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
       the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
       Committee.
  
   30. ADDED TO REFERENCES - Added the following elements to 
       %references.class so that it would be allowed inside all 
       citation types, product, et al.
        - conf-acronym
        - data-title (for citing datasets and parts of datasets)
        - version (for data and software, similar to edition)
  
   29. STATEMENT - Added new statement.class, so that statements
       can be recursive.
  
   28. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
   27. ADDRESS ELEMENTS IN NEW CLASSES
        - Added 3 new elements: <city>, <state>, <postal-code>
            - address.class
            - address-line.class
          which adds then to: address, addr-line, add, collab, 
          conf-loc, corresp, publisher-loc      
  
       =============================================================

   23. INSTITUTION-WRAP ADDED
       Added the element <institution-wrap> to the following classes:
        - address.class
        - address-line.class
        - recipient-name.class
        - references.class
  
   18. RUBY
       - Added <ruby> to emphasis class
       - Added a face-markup class (all the emphasis class except 
           <ruby>) for use inside <ruby>
  
   17. ADDED NEW CLASSES (for new locations for the elements)

       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   16. CITATION ALTERNATIVES - Added a new element 
       <citation-alternatives> to the citation.class. The element
       will hold, for example, a single citation in multiple
       languages or a single citation tagged as a <mixed-citation>
       complete with punctuation and spacing and also as an
       <element-citation> with all punctuation and spacing removed.
  
   15. CONTRIBUTOR ID CLASS - Created a new class "contrib-id.class"
       to hold identifiers for people such as contributors such
       as <contrib> and <principal-investigator>s. This will hold
       publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, and JST and NII identifiers.
  
   14. NESTED KEYWORD CLASS - Created a new class "nested-kwd.class"
       to hold the kinds of keywords that can be used inside
       a nested keyword structure.
  
   13. COLLAB CLASS - Created a new class "collab.class" to hold 
       only the element <collab>, for use in the element
       <collab-alternatives>.
  
   12. COLLABORATION ALTERNATIVES - Added <collab-alternatives> to
       the name.class and -references.class to allow the
       <collab-alternatives> element to occur anywhere <collab> 
       was already used.
  
   11. STANDARDS CLASS - Created a new class "std.class" to hold all
       the elements inside the <std> element within citations.
  
   10. REFERENCES CLASS - Added <issn-l> to the class.
  
    9. NOTHING BUT PARA CLASS - Added a new %nothing-but-para.class;
       to get rid of PE clashes when the entity %just-para.class; needed
       to be expanded to include other elements. The nothing-but
       parameter entity contains <p> and only <p> and should never
       be changed in a customization. The infelicitously-named PE
       %just-para.class; can be modified for a customization to include
       other elements as well.
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
    8. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
    7. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.
  
    6. NEW CLASS FOR just <alt-text> %small-access.class;
       Since not everything needs a <long-desc>
  
    5. ALTERNATIVES - Added <private-char> so that the alternatives
       wrapper may be used to hold alternative characters, some as
       <private-char>, some as <textual-form>, some as <graphic>,
       etc.
  
    4. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
       to hold multiple <aff>s that are representations of a single
       affiliation, for example, the name of an institution in two
       languages or two scripts.
        -  contrib-info.class
        -  person-group-info.class
        -  Made a new class %aff-alternatives.class to hold just
           <aff> and <aff-alternatives> NEW PE
  
    3. NAME ALTERNATIVES - Added a new container element to hold
       alternate versions of a person's name, for example:
         -  a Roman alphabet transliteration, the Japanese characters,
            and the Japanese with Ruby annotations or
         -  the full peerage title of a person as well as a name
            that is just surname and given names
         -  a name and a sort version of the name that transliterates
            the diacritics (such as cedillas and umlauts) to the same
            character with no diacritic.
       a. This structure was added to %name.class;
       b. This structure was added to %investigator-name.class;
       c. This structure was added to %recipient-name.class;
       d. This structure was added to %references.class;
  
    2. ROLE - Added <role> to %person-group-info.class; thereby
       adding it to: <person-group> and <sig-block>
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
  
    1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"
